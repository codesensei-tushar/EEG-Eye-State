# Cognitive State Classification from EEG
- **Project Overview**
  - Goal: Classify cognitive states (e.g., relaxation vs. concentration) using EEG.
  - Key Elements:
    - Transfer Learning with foundation models
    - Custom Neural Network (e.g., CNN or CNN-LSTM)
    - End-to-End Deep Learning Pipeline
    - Evaluation & Visual Reporting
- **Data Acquisition**
  - Consider public datasets like:
    - DEAP
    - DREAMER or SEED
  - Download and explore dataset format (.edf files, metadata, etc.)
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Filtering (e.g., 0.5â€“40 Hz)
  - Artifact Removal (using methods like ICA)
  - Segmentation (divide into epochs based on events)
  - Normalization and optional feature transformation (Fourier/Wavelet)
- **Model Architecture**
  - **Custom Neural Network Approach:**
    - Input layer: Reshape EEG epochs appropriately
    - Convolutional & Pooling layers: Feature extraction
    - Fully connected layers: Classification mapping
    - Output layer: Softmax for multi-class classification
  - **Transfer Learning Approach:**
    - Utilize a pre-trained time-series model
    - Fine-tune final layers or use as feature extractor
- **End-to-End Deep Learning Pipeline**
  - Data Loading: Use libraries like MNE
  - Preprocessing: Apply filtering, segmentation, normalization
  - Model Building: Create custom or transfer learning-based network
  - Training: Optimize using Adam, monitor accuracy/loss
  - Evaluation: Validate using performance metrics
  - Visualization: Plot loss/accuracy curves, confusion matrices, and feature embeddings
- **Evaluation Metrics & Visual Reporting**
  - Metrics:
    - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
    - Confusion Matrix, ROC Curves
  - Visualizations:
    - Loss/Accuracy curves
    - Confusion matrix heatmaps
    - Dimensionality reduction plots (t-SNE, UMAP)
- **Sample Code Outline**
  - Pseudocode for:
    - Data loading & preprocessing
    - CNN model building (using Keras)
    - Training and evaluation procedures
    - Visualization of performance metrics
- **Next Steps**
  - Experiment with transfer learning integration
  - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
  - Explore adaptation for real-time EEG classification
